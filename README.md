It's my my app-cv. Something like that :)

### Description:
In fact, I donâ€™t know how this application can be used in practice, but it should definitely be fun to use - while the user moves through the interface, I communicate with him through the view and show him how everything works there :)

In this application I demonstrate working with these technologies:
- SwiftUI
- MVVM
- Async-Await
- URLSession
- JSON
- UserDefaults
- Animations

### The tasks was:
1. Make an app that will demonstrate how I use the technologies I know about in practice;
2. Simulate sign in using login and password and use UserDefaults to store data about whether login/logout was completed and display the start screen based on this;
3. Create a custom alert;
4. Asynchronously load data and image from the NASA website and display it on the screen before the user gets to it;
5. Simulate a list of contacts with the ability to create a new contact, delete it and display the contact page by clicking on a cell;
6. Create a user profile and add the ability to change his data, which is also stored in UserDefaults;
7. Create a custom TabBar
and a few more tasks.
